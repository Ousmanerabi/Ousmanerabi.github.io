## 🧬 Clinical Trials Programming (CDISC / SAS)

*Regulatory-compliant workflows for clinical data analysis and submission-ready deliverables.*

My clinical programming work focuses on **end-to-end pipelines** for clinical trial data using SAS and CDISC standards.  
These projects replicate **real-world regulatory workflows**, from raw data cleaning to **submission-ready outputs**.

### Highlighted Capabilities

- SDTM and ADaM dataset derivation  
- Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) programming  
- Define-XML and annotated CRF support  
- QC checks and validation workflows  

### Featured Projects

🔹 [End-to-End Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM)](projects/cdisc-sdtm.html)  
🔹 [ADaM BDS Derivations for Efficacy & Safety](projects/ADaM BDS Derivations for Efficacy & Safety.html)  
🔹 [Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs)](projects/Tables Listings and Figures.html)  
🔹 [define.xml Generation & Validation Workflow](projects/sdtm-validation-project.html)  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #0454a4; opacity: 0.15; margin: 2rem 0;">

## 💰 Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR)

*Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses supporting value-based healthcare decisions.*

These projects apply **economic evaluation and outcomes research** methods to clinical and public health programs, highlighting the impact of interventions on cost and health outcomes.

### Featured Projects

🔹 [Cost-Effectiveness of the REPPOP Pediatric Obesity Management Program](projects/cost-effectiveness-reppop.html)  
🔹 [Cost-Utility of Lung Transplantation](projects/Cost-utility-Lung-Transplantation.html)  

They demonstrate experience with:

- Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility models  
- Decision-analytic frameworks and sensitivity analyses  
- Communication of results for policymakers and healthcare stakeholders  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #0454a4; opacity: 0.15; margin: 2rem 0;">

## 📊 Real-World Evidence (RWE) & Statistical Modeling

*Observational analytics and evidence generation for clinical and public health impact.*

This section covers **observational research** and **real-world data analyses** that inform clinical and policy decisions.  
The projects integrate data from surveys, hospitals, and surveillance systems.

### Featured Projects

🔹 [Patient-level Risk Factors for Clinical Malaria in Children (2–60 months)](projects/patient-level-risk-factors-analysis.html)  
🔹 [Hospital Mortality and Positive Blood Culture with Difficult-to-Treat Resistance – Marseille, France](projects/hospital-mortality-and-positive-blood-culture.html)  
🔹 [Major Discrepancy Between Factual Antibiotic Resistance and Consumption in Southern France](projects/major_consumption.html)  

These projects highlight:

- Study design for observational data  
- Regression modeling and risk factor analysis  
- Translation of findings into actionable recommendations  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #0454a4; opacity: 0.15; margin: 2rem 0;">

## 🗺️ Geospatial Analysis & Epidemiology

*Spatial and spatio-temporal modeling for malaria surveillance and intervention planning.*

Here, I use **geospatial methods and epidemiological modeling** to understand how disease risk and intervention coverage vary across space and time.

### Featured Projects

🔹 [Risk Factors – ITN Use in Guinea (DHS 2018)](projects/risk_factors.html)  
🔹 [Spatio-temporal Modeling of Treatment-Seeking Coverage Using DHS Data and INLA](projects/treatment-seeking-bfa.html)  
🔹 [Retrospective Analysis of Malaria Trends in Burkina Faso](projects/retrospective_analysis.html)  

Key themes include:

- Spatial risk mapping and cluster detection  
- Linking survey, facility, and environmental data  
- Supporting targeted intervention strategies  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #0454a4; opacity: 0.15; margin: 2rem 0;">

## 🤖 Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics

*Advanced modeling and classification for outcome prediction and health system performance.*

These projects apply **machine learning and multivariate methods** to extract patterns and build predictive models from complex health data.

### Featured Projects

🔹 [Seasonality Archetypes Using Machine Learning](projects/seasonality-archetypes.html)  
🔹 [Predictors of Insecticide-Treated Net Ownership and Use in Guinea](projects/predictors-itn-guinea.html)  

Methods used include:

- Clustering and dimensionality reduction  
- Supervised learning for classification and prediction  
- Interpretation of models in a public health context
