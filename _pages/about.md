<br/>

I am a rigorous biostatistician and epidemiologist with over 9 years of experience in health data analytics, statistical modeling, and large-scale data management. Certified in SAS Base Programming and Clinical Trials Programming, I am transitioning from academia to the pharmaceutical industry to apply my expertise in CDISC standards (SDTM/ADaM) and real-world evidence (RWE) to clinical research and regulatory submissions. With a proven track record in international projects, I excel in collaborative environments, delivering submission-ready insights and supporting high-quality publications.

## My Transition to Pharma/Industry
My academic background in epidemiology and biostatistics, combined with hands-on SAS training and CDISC projects, has prepared me to contribute to clinical trials and RWE studies. Projects like my end-to-end CDISC workflow (SDTM/ADaM, TLF, define.xml) demonstrate my ability to deliver regulatory-compliant deliverables, while my R-based DHS analysis showcases transferable skills for RWE and observational studies.
