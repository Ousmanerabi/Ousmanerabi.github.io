My name is Ousmane DIALLO, I am an MD and infectious disease epidemiologist and passionate about data analysis in health-related research.
Many diseases and advserse health outcomes are preventable and, or treatable - that is what drives me in my work. 
I am widely interested in using quantitative tools, from data analysis to find influencing factors for a health/disease outcome, 
to simulation modeling to project likely impact of interventions in a population. 
<br/>

I have worked for several years on the epidemiological surveillance of antibiotic resistance and on epidemiological surveillance systems for bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. I have worked in Africa, Europe and the USA.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [NU malaria modeling group](https://www.numalariamodeling.org/) at Northwestern University, Chicago, USA. 
I hold a Ph.D. and M.PH.'s degree in Infectious disease and Public Health from the [Aix Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/), France.
I received a M.D in [University of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea](https://uganc.edu.gn/).
