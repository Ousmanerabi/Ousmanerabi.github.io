Understanding the factors influencing household ITN ownership and usage among those with access will enable the Guinea National Malaria Control Programme to design targeted interventions aimed at increasing bed net coverage and utilization.\n\n## Research Leadership & Study Design\n\n**Independent Research Initiative**:\n\nConceived, designed, and executed comprehensive epidemiological analysis of ITN utilization patterns in Guinea using complex survey methodology. Led complete research lifecycle from study conceptualization through manuscript publication and policy dissemination.\n\n**Research Innovation**:\n\nDeveloped analytical framework addressing both household-level ownership and individual-level usage patterns, incorporating complex survey design features often overlooked in DHS analyses. Published methodology serves as template for similar national-level studies.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Study Design\n\n-   **Data Source**: Guinea DHS 2018 (nationally representative)\n-   **Study Population**: Households and individuals across Guinea's administrative regions\n-   **Analytical Approach**: Multi-level logistic regression with survey weights\n\n### Key Variables Analyzed\n\n**Outcomes**:\n\n-   ITN ownership at household level\n\n-   ITN usage the previous night (among those with access) at individual-level\n\n**Predictors**:\n\n-   **Socioeconomic**: Wealth quintiles, education level, household size\n\n-   **Demographic**: Age and sex of household head, marital status, pregnancy status\n\n-   **Geographic**: Urban/rural residence, administrative region\n\n-   **Structural**: Number of rooms, presence of children under 5\n\n### Statistical Methods\n\n**Complex Survey Design Adjustment**:\n\n-   Survey weights applied for population representativeness\n\n-   Stratification and clustering accounted for in variance estimation\n\n-   Design effects calculated for precision assessment\n\n**Analytical Framework**:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Install and charge the survey design library\n\nlibrary(survey)\n\n## \n# Survey design specification\n\ndesign_sample <- svydesign(\n  ids = ~hv021, \n  strata = ~hv022, \n  weights = ~wt,\n  num_p=1,\n  nest = T,\n  data = hh_ex\n)\n\n## Bivariate analysis\n\nexplanatory_vars <- c(\"wealth\", \"sex\", \"urb\", \"Num_childre\", \"region\", \"rooms\", \"hh_size\", \"Edu\", \"head_age\", \"Marital\")\n\nfor(i in 1:length(explanatory_vars)){\n  col = explanatory_vars[i]\n  tbl <- survey::svytable(~HH_at_least_one + col, design_sample_hh)\n  t = summary(tbl, statistic=\"Chisq\")\n  t = plyr::ldply(t)\n}\n\n\n## Univariate analysis of different risk factors for ITN ownership at the country level \n\nmodels <- explanatory_vars %>%      \n  stringr::str_c(\"HH_at_least_one ~ \", .) %>%      \n  \n  # iterate through each univariate formula\n  purrr::map(                               \n    .f = ~survey::svyglm(                      \n      formula = as.formula(.x),      \n      family = \"binomial\",           \n      design = design_sample_hh)) %>%       \n  \n\n  purrr::map(\n    .f = ~broom::tidy(\n      .x, \n      exponentiate = TRUE,           \n      conf.int = TRUE)) %>%         \n  \n \n  dplyr::bind_rows() %>% \n  \n  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Visual Highlights\n\n### \n\n![Regional variation in Guinea of A household ITN ownership;
