The main indications for transplantation include cystic fibrosis, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Despite improved allocation systems and reduced waiting list mortality, long-term survival remains limited—approximately 70% at one year and below 50% at five years. While lung transplantation has proven effective in improving survival and quality of life, no cost-utility evaluation has been conducted in France.\nThis projet therefore aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of lung and heart–lung transplantation compared with medical management.\n\n## Methodology Framework\n\n### Data sources\n\nThe study was based on data collected at Foch Hospital (Suresnes, France), a national reference center and pioneer in lung transplantation.\nThe institutional database includes all patients followed for lung or heart–lung transplantation since 1989.\nFor this analysis, only records with complete demographic and clinical information (date of birth, hospital identifier, transplant date) were retained.\n\nThe dataset comprised:\n\n- **Sociodemographic and occupational variables**,\n\n- **Clinical and paraclinical data**,\n\n- **Hospitalization and follow-up information**\n\n- **Quality-of-life assessments using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire**.\n\n\n### Data summary\n\nBetween 1989 and January 2015, **631 patients** were recorded in the Foch Hospital cohort, including **571 transplanted patients (90.5%)** and **60 awaiting transplantation (9.5%)**.\nThe **sex ratio was balanced** (≈50% female), with a **mean age of 38.8 years** at listing.\n\nThe primary indications for transplantation were:\n\n- **Cystic fibrosis (50%)**,\n\n- **Emphysema/COPD (21%)**,\n\n- **Interstitial lung disease (15%)**, and\n\n- **Other etiologies (12%)**.\n\nAs of May 2015, **42.5% of patients had died**, and **19 patients (3%)** underwent a second transplantation.\n\nQuality-of-life data were available for **302 transplanted patients** (pre- and post-transplant), assessed through the NHP dimensions: pain, mobility, sleep, energy, emotions, and social isolation.\nThese scores were converted to EQ-5D utilities using a validated mapping algorithm to enable QALY computation for cost-utility analysis.\n\n### Methodology\n\nA **retrospective cohort design** was used to evaluate the **cost-utility** of lung and heart–lung transplantation compared with continued medical management.\nThe analysis integrated survival modeling, utility estimation, and cost evaluation from the **French National Health Insurance (Assurance Maladie)** perspective.\n\n#### Study Groups\n\n- **Transplantation group (TP)**: All transplanted patients since 2005 with at least one pre- and post-transplant quality-of-life measure.\nMean post-transplant survival was estimated using a **parametric Weibull model** (time origin = transplantation date).\n\n- **Medical management group**:\nBecause randomization is ethically infeasible and few patients die untransplanted, a direct control group could not be constructed.\n\nInstead, **pseudo-controls** were generated using **literature-derived hazard ratios** to estimate counterfactual survival in the absence of transplantation.\n\n#### Costing perspective\n\nCosts were estimated from the **payer perspective (Assurance Maladie)** and included:\n\n**Hospital costs** based on Diagnosis-Related Group [GHS/GHM] tariffs for transplantation),\n\n**Ambulatory care and potential post-acute care** (SSR/HAD), and\n\n**Expert-based estimates or complementary data** from Foch Hospital when necessary.\n\nThe final **cost-utility analysis** compared transplantation with medical management and expressed results as an **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, reported in **cost per QALY gained**.\n\n\n## Results Summary\n\n### Descriptive Overview\n\nThe synthetic cohort reproduced the demographic and clinical characteristics of the original Foch Hospital population.  \nThe mean age at listing was **38.8 years** (range 11–72), with an equal sex distribution (≈50% female).  \nAmong **631 patients**, **571 (90.5%)** underwent transplantation and **60 (9.5%)** remained on the waiting list.  \nThe main indications for transplantation were **cystic fibrosis (50%)**, **COPD/emphysema (21%)**, and **interstitial lung disease (15%)**.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Demographic summary table\"}\ndf %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_age = mean(AGE),\n    sd_age = sd(AGE),\n    prop_female = mean(SEX == 0),\n    prop_transplanted = mean(TRANSPLANTED == 1)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Survival Analysis\n\nA parametric Weibull survival model was fitted to censored post-transplant data.\n\n| Parameter | Estimate      | 95% CI      |\n| --------- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| Shape (k) | **1.36**      | 1.03 – 1.78 |\n| Scale (λ) | **1670 days** | 1320 – 2010 |\n: {.striped .hover}\n\nThe hazard function indicated an increasing risk of death over time (k > 1).\n\nPredicted survival probabilities were:\n\n| Time since TP | Survival Probability (S(t)) |\n| ------------- | --------------------------- |\n| 1 year        | **0.90**                    |\n| 2 years       | **0.76**                    |\n| 3 years       | **0.61**                    |\n| 4 years       | **0.47**                    |\n| 5 years       | **0.34**                    |\n\n: {.striped .hover}\n\nThe **median survival** was approximately **4.2 years**, consistent with national registry data.\n\n### Quality of Life (QoL)\n\nQuality of life, assessed with the **Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)** and mapped to **EQ-5D utilities**, showed clear improvement after transplantation:\n\n| Utility Measure  | Mean (Pre-TP) | Mean (Post-TP) |\n| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |\n| EQ-5D Utility    | **0.30**      | **0.60**       |\n| Δ Utility (gain) | —             | **+0.30**      |\n\n: {.striped .hover}\n\n### Cost–Utility Analysis \n\nFrom the Assurance Maladie (payer) perspective:\n\n| Parameter                   | Value                        |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| Time horizon                | 10 years                     |\n| Discount rate               | 3%                           |\n| Hazard ratio (non-TP vs TP) | 1.8                          |\n| Incremental QALYs           | **+1.2**                     |\n| Incremental Cost            | **€120,000**                 |\n| ICER                        | **€100,000 per QALY gained** |\n\n: {.striped .hover}\n\nAlthough the ICER exceeded the typical French threshold (€50,000/QALY), the result reflects the **high initial cost** of transplantation balanced by substantial gains in survival and quality of life.\n\n### Sensitivity Analyses\n\n- **One-way sensitivity** identified the **hazard ratio** and **post-transplant utility** as the most influential parameters on the ICER.\n\n- **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)** showed that transplantation was **cost-effective in ~40% of simulations** at a willingness-to-pay threshold of **€100,000/QALY**.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- The Weibull model accurately described post-transplant survival.\n\n- Lung transplantation resulted in **substantial QALY gains** despite high upfront costs.\n\n- The workflow demonstrates a complete HEOR pipeline: **survival modeling, utility mapping, and cost-effectiveness evaluation**, all with **synthetic, ethically shareable data**.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Ethical statement  \nThe dataset used in this report is synthetic and was generated to replicate the structure and statistical characteristics of the Foch Hospital lung transplantation cohort.  \nNo real patient information is included.  \nThe study and analyses are presented for educational and methodological purposes only.\n\n:::",
