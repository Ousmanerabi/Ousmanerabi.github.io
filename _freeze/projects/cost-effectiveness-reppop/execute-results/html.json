The **two-year growth rate (X)** in BMI *Z*-score was computed for each child.\\\n2.  This growth rate was then modeled using a **multiple linear regression**, stratified by age group, with predictors: *age at onset of overweight*, *initial BMI Z-score*, *social difficulties*, and *gender*.\n\nThe model can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nX_i \\;=\\; \\beta_0 \\;+\\; \\beta_1\\,\\mathrm{AgeOnset}_i \\;+\\; \\beta_2\\,\\mathrm{ZBMI}_{i0}\n\\;+\\; \\beta_3\\,\\mathrm{Social}_i \\;+\\; \\beta_4\\,\\mathrm{Gender}_i \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_i,\n\\qquad \\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal N(0,\\sigma^{2}).\n$$\n\nTo incorporate predictive uncertainty, random residuals were drawn from a normal distribution and added to the predicted growth rates, generating individualized simulated Z-scores:\n\n$$\nZ_{i,\\mathrm{sim}} \\;=\\; Z_{i,\\mathrm{init}} \\;+\\; X_{i,\\mathrm{sim}}.\n$$\n\nThis approach allowed comparing each child’s *observed* BMI Z-score trajectory (with REPOP) to their *simulated* trajectory (no REPPOP).\n\n#### **Example of R code**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Model & simulate counterfactual (no REPPOP)\"}\n# ============================================================================\n# Fit linear regression model for 2-year growth rate\n# Framework: X' = β0 + β1*Age + β2*Z0 + β3*Social + β4*Sex + ε\n# ============================================================================\nmodel_gr <- lm(growth_rate2 ~ age_inc1 + zbmi_incl + social + sex, data = dat)\nsummary(model_gr)\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Extract residual standard error (σ̂) for simulating uncertainty\n# ============================================================================\nsigma_hat <- sqrt(sum(residuals(model_gr)^2) / model_gr$df.residual)\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Predict growth rate + draw from normal distribution to add uncertainty\n# ============================================================================\nset.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility\n\n# Predicted growth rate from model (X̂)\npred_rate <- predict(model_gr, newdata = dat)\n\n# Draw random residuals from normal distribution: ε ~ N(0, σ̂)\neps_draw <- rnorm(nrow(dat), mean = 0, sd = sigma_hat)\n\n# Simulated growth rate with uncertainty: X_sim = X̂ + ε\nrate_sim <- pred_rate + eps_draw\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Counterfactual ZBMI at 2 years under \"no REPOP\" scenario\n# ============================================================================\nzbmi_cf <- dat$zbmi_incl + rate_sim\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Individual and mean incremental effectiveness\n# ============================================================================\n# ΔE_i = Z_noTx(2y) -

N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;REPOP}}}\n     {N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;simulated}}}\n\\times 100\n$$\n\nwhere (N\\_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;simulated}}) is the number of children classified as obese at 2 years in the no-intervention (counterfactual) simulation, and (N\\_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;REPOP}}) is the number observed after REPOP care.\n\n#### **Discounted Cost Savings**\n\nThe present value (PV) of avoided obesity-related costs was computed as:\n\n**Simple (T-year horizon):** $$\nPV \\;=\\; \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{p \\times C}{(1+r)^{t}}\n$$\n\n**Age-based (benefits from age (a_s) to (a_e), intervention at age (a_0)):** $$\nPV \\;=\\; \\sum_{a=a_s}^{a_e-1} \\frac{p \\times C}{(1+r)^{\\,a - a_0}}\n$$\n\nwith:\n\n-   (p): proportion of obesity cases prevented (e.g., (16%) (\\Rightarrow) use (p=0.16)),\n\n-   (C): mean **annual** direct medical cost of obesity (from the national cost study),\n\n-   (r): annual discount rate (e.g., (0.02) or (0.04)),\n\n-   (T): number of years of accrual (simple form),\n\n-   (a_0): age at intervention start, (a_s): benefit start age, (a_e): benefit end age (age-based form).\n\nThis calculation provides an estimate of the discounted long-term cost offsets achieved through the REPOP program, based on its short-term effectiveness in reducing pediatric obesity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Efficiency-longterm\"}\n# ============================================================================\n# Calculate long-term cost offsets using present value (PV)\n# ============================================================================\n\n# Function to compute present value of avoided future costs\n# p: probability of avoiding obesity case\n# C: annual direct medical cost of obesity (EUR)\n# r: discount rate (annual)\n# a0: current age (baseline)\n# a_start: age when cost savings begin\n# a_end: age when cost savings end\n# ============================================================================\n# Long-term cost offsets: Present value of avoided obesity costs\n# ============================================================================\n\n# Function to compute present value of avoided future costs\n# Based on age-based discounting formula from methods section\npv_avoided <- function(p, C, r, a0, a_start, a_end) {\n  # Age-based formula: PV = Σ [p × C / (1+r)^(a -
