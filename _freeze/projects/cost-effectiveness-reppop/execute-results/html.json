The **two-year growth rate (X)** in BMI *Z*-score was computed for each child.  \n2. This growth rate was then modeled using a **multiple linear regression**, stratified by age group, with predictors: *age at onset of overweight*, *initial BMI Z-score*, *social difficulties*, and *gender*.\n\nThe model can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nX_i \\;=\\; \\beta_0 \\;+\\; \\beta_1\\,\\mathrm{AgeOnset}_i \\;+\\; \\beta_2\\,\\mathrm{ZBMI}_{i0}\n\\;+\\; \\beta_3\\,\\mathrm{Social}_i \\;+\\; \\beta_4\\,\\mathrm{Gender}_i \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_i,\n\\qquad \\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal N(0,\\sigma^{2}).\n$$\n\nTo incorporate uncertainty, random residuals were drawn from a normal distribution and added to the predicted growth rates, generating individualized simulated Z-scores:\n\n$$\nZ_{i,\\mathrm{sim}} \\;=\\; Z_{i,\\mathrm{init}} \\;+\\; X_{i,\\mathrm{sim}}.\n$$\n\n\nThis approach allowed comparing each child’s *observed* BMI Z-score trajectory (with REPOP) to their *simulated* trajectory (without REPPOP).\n\n#### Example of R code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Model-simulate-counterfactual\"}\n# ============================================================================\n# Stratified multiple linear regression of 2-year growth rate by age band\n# ============================================================================\n\nfits <- dat %>% \n  # Group data by age band for stratified analysis\n  group_by(age_band) %>% \n  \n  # Create a list-column containing data for each group\n  nest() %>% \n  \n  mutate(\n    # Fit a linear regression model for each age band\n    # Predictors: baseline BMI-Z, sex, age at onset, social factors\n    # Outcome: observed growth rate\n    model = map(data, ~ lm(growth_rate_obs ~ zbmi_incl + sex + age_onset + social, \n                           data = .x)),\n    \n    # Extract residual standard error (sigma) from each model\n    # Used to simulate natural data variability\n    sigma = map_dbl(model, ~ summary(.x)$sigma),\n    \n    # Predict mean value (mu) for each observation\n    # Based on the fitted model\n    pred_mu = map2(model, data, ~ predict(.x, newdata = .y)),\n    \n    # Generate random residuals following a normal distribution\n    # Mean = 0, standard deviation = model sigma\n    resid_rnd = map2(pred_mu, sigma, ~ rnorm(length(.x), 0, .y)),\n    \n    # Create simulated growth by adding residual noise\n    # to predictions (mu + epsilon)\n    growth_sim = map2(pred_mu, resid_rnd, ~ .x + .y)\n  )\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Attach simulated growth and build counterfactual Z-score at 2 years\n# ============================================================================\n\nsim <- fits %>% \n  # Select only necessary columns\n  select(age_band, data, growth_sim) %>% \n  \n  # Unnest data to return to tabular format\n  unnest(c(data, growth_sim)) %>% \n  \n  mutate(\n    # Calculate counterfactual Z-score at 2 years (scenario WITHOUT REPOP intervention)\n    # Baseline Z + simulated growth\n    z_sim_2y = zbmi_incl + growth_sim,\n    \n    # Observed change in Z-score WITH REPOP intervention\n    # (difference between final Z and baseline Z)\n    delta_z_repop = zbmi_last - zbmi_incl,\n    \n    # Simulated change in Z-score WITHOUT intervention\n    # (difference between counterfactual Z and baseline Z)\n    delta_z_nocare = z_sim_2y - zbmi_incl\n  )\n\n# ============================================================================\n# Quick check: display model coefficients for the first age band\n# ============================================================================\n\nfits$model[[1]] %>% tidy()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\nThe cost-effectiveness model was conducted from the payer perspective (French national health insurance).\nIn line with recommendations from the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), the therapeutic goal in children is not weight loss but rather stabilization or deceleration of BMI growth.\n\nAccordingly, two measures of effectiveness were used:\n\n- a normative criterion — stabilization of BMI Z-score (no increase), and\n\n- a quantitative criterion — the cost per one-unit reduction in BMI Z-score over two years.\n\nOnly direct medical costs were included in the analysis, covering physician, dietitian, psychologist, and inclusion consultations.\nAll costs were expressed in euros (€) and not discounted, given the short (two-year) time horizon of the REPOP intervention.\n\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was computed as the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean effects between the REPPOP intervention and the “no-intervention” simulated scenario:\n\n$$\nICER \\;=\\; \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\n\nwhere ΔC is the incremental cost and ΔE the incremental effectiveness (reduction in BMI Z-score).\n\n#### **Uncertainty Analysis**\n\nTo account for sampling uncertainty, a non-parametric bootstrap method was applied with 10,000 replications.\nIn each bootstrap sample, mean costs and mean effects were recalculated, and the ICER was recomputed.\nThe 95% confidence interval for the ICER was derived using the percentile method, by discarding the lowest and highest 2.5% of simulated ICER values.\n\nThis approach is recommended when no strong assumptions can be made regarding the distribution of incremental costs and effects.\nThe resulting bootstrap replications were plotted on the cost-effectiveness (CE) plane, illustrating the joint uncertainty around the incremental cost and incremental effectiveness estimates.\n\n\n### Efficiency Analysis (Long-Term Cost Offsets)\n\nTo estimate the long-term cost savings associated with the REPOP intervention, we used data from a French national study that assessed the medical costs attributable to obesity in France.\nThis reference study combined data from the 2002 Health, Health-Care and Insurance Survey (ESPS) and the Permanent Sample of Health Insurance Beneficiaries (EPAS), covering the three main social security schemes.\nIt provided national estimates of annual direct medical costs associated with obesity, used here to extrapolate the future costs avoided through the REPPOP program.\n\nAssumptions were made regarding the percentage of obesity cases prevented by the intervention and the discount rate applied to future costs.\nWe assumed that 16% of obesity cases were avoided among REPPOP participants, and annual costs were discounted at 2% and 4%, consistent with French health-economic guidelines.\n\n#### **Number of Obesity Cases Prevented**\n\nThe proportion of obesity cases prevented after two years of REPOP care was calculated as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Obesity Prevented (\\%)} \\;=\\;\n\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;simulated}} - N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;REPOP}}}\n     {N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;simulated}}}\n\\times 100\n$$\n\nwhere \\(N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;simulated}}\\) is the number of children classified as obese at 2 years in the no-intervention (counterfactual) simulation, and \\(N_{\\mathrm{obese,\\;REPOP}}\\) is the number observed after REPOP care.\n\n\n#### **Discounted Cost Savings**\n\nThe present value (PV) of avoided obesity-related costs was computed as:\n\n**Simple (T-year horizon):**\n$$\nPV \\;=\\; \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{p \\times C}{(1+r)^{t}}\n$$\n\n**Age-based (benefits from age \\(a_s\\) to \\(a_e\\), intervention at age \\(a_0\\)):**\n$$\nPV \\;=\\; \\sum_{a=a_s}^{a_e-1} \\frac{p \\times C}{(1+r)^{\\,a - a_0}}\n$$\n\nwith:\n\n- \\(p\\): proportion of obesity cases prevented (e.g., \\(16\\%\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) use \\(p=0.16\\)),\n\n- \\(C\\): mean **annual** direct medical cost of obesity (from the national cost study),\n\n- \\(r\\): annual discount rate (e.g., \\(0.02\\) or \\(0.04\\)),\n\n- \\(T\\): number of years of accrual (simple form),\n\n- \\(a_0\\): age at intervention start, \\(a_s\\): benefit start age, \\(a_e\\): benefit end age (age-based form).\n\nThis calculation provides an estimate of the discounted long-term cost offsets achieved through the REPOP program, based on its short-term effectiveness in reducing pediatric obesity.\n\n\n## Results\n\n### Baseline Characteristics\n\nThe REPPOP cohort included **553 children** (57.7% girls, sex ratio 0.7) with a mean age of **9.4 years (SD = 2.3)** and a mean age at onset of overweight of **2.7 years (SD = 1.6)**.\nThe mean baseline BMI Z-score was **3.34 SD (SD = 0.97); 52.5%** of participants were classified as obese and **47.5%** as overweight.\nOverall, 16.6% of children had documented social difficulties.\nDuring the two-year program, participants attended on average **5.6 medical, 8.1 psychological, and 8.0 dietary** consultations.\n\n### Simulation of the Natural History of Obesity\n\nIn the regression model predicting BMI Z-score growth rate, a one-point increase in BMI Z-score at baseline was associated with a **57% higher estimated growth rate (p < 0.05)**.\nFor example, among girls aged 2–4 years, with onset of overweight at 3 years and initial BMI Z-score = 1.95 SD, the predicted growth rate was **1.63 [95% CI: 1.01–2.26]**.\n\n| **Variable**                | **Coefficient** | **Std.
