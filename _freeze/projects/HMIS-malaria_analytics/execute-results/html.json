It demonstrates skills in data wrangling, quality assessment, and visualization—key for roles in pharmacoepidemiology, health analytics, or public health research\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Data sources and unit of analysis\n\n-   **Source**: DHIS2 routine HMIS exports (malaria indicators and related service statistics)\\\n-   **Unit of analysis**: health facility × month × year\\\n-   **Geographic level**: national, aggregated into regions and districts (no facility identifiers displayed in the report)\n\nKey malaria indicators used in this project include:\n\n| Indicator     | Description                               | Age Groups            | Example Use Case            |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| allout        | Outpatient visits (all causes)             | All, <5y, >5y          | Denominator for incidence rates |\n| susp          | Suspected malaria cases                    | All, <5y, >5y          | Suspicion surveillance       |\n| test          | Tested cases (RDT + microscopy)            | All, <5y, >5y          | Diagnostic coverage          |\n| conf          | Confirmed malaria cases                    | All, <5y, >5y          | Confirmed incidence          |\n| maltreat      | Treated uncomplicated cases                | All, <5y, >5y          | Treatment access             |\n| confsev       | Confirmed severe cases                     | All, <5y, >5y          | Severity monitoring          |\n| maldth        | Malaria-related deaths                     | All, <5y, >5y          | Mortality tracking           |\n| IPTp/Stocks   | Preventive interventions & commodities      | Pregnant women         | Activity flags               |\n\n: {.striped .hover}\n\n**Challenges Addressed:** Recurrent missing data, French month names, facility name inconsistencies across years.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Data management & indicator construction in R\n\nThe R pipeline performs the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cleaning and recoding**\n\n    -   Selects and renames geographic and time variables (region, district, health facility, month, year).\n    -   Recodes **French month names to numeric months** and splits the period variable into `month` and `year` (`case_when` and `separate`).\n    -   Standardizes age groups:\n        -   \\<5 years, 5–14 years, ≥15 years, and combined groups (under-5 vs over-5).\n\n2.  **Construction of aggregate indicators** Using `dplyr::rowwise()` and `mutate()`, the script creates:\n\n    -   **Total outpatient visits**: allout, allout_u5, allout_ov5\\\n    -   **Admissions**: alladm, alladm_u5, alladm_ov5\\\n    -   **Suspected, tested, confirmed cases**:\n        -   `susp`, `test` (RDT + microscopy), `conf` (RDT + microscopy)\\\n    -   **Treatment and severity**:\n        -   `maltreat` (treated uncomplicated cases),\\\n        -   `pressev`, `confsev` (presumed and confirmed severe cases)\\\n    -   **Malaria deaths**: `maldth` (overall and age-specific)\n\n3.  **Zero to NA recoding for analytical indicators**\n\n    -   For malaria indicators, zeros are recoded to `NA` to distinguish true zeros from non-reporting.\n    \n    \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code: Data management\"}\ntdata = st\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Data-quality indicators\n\n### 1. Missing data by indicator, month, and district\n\nUsing `group_by()` and `across()`:\n\n-   Counts the **number of missing values per indicator** at district × month × year level.\\\n-   Joins the number of reporting facilities to compute the **percentage of missing values**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Missingness }(\\%) =\n\\frac{N_{\\text{facilities with NA}}}{N_{\\text{facilities reporting in district}}} \\times 100\n$$\n\n\nThe resulting dataset (`*_missing_data`) includes:\n\n-   Region, district, month, year\\\n-   Indicator type (visits, suspected, tested, confirmed, treated, admissions, deaths)\\\n-   Age category (under-5, over-5, all ages)\\\n-   Numerator (facilities with missing data) and denominator (total facilities)\\\n-   **Proportion of missing data (%)**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code:Missing Data\"}\ndata = t\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2. Outlier detection and imputation\n\nThe pipeline applies two complementary methods:\n\n1.  **Mean ± 3 standard deviations**\n    -   For each indicator, computes mean and SD across all facility-months.\\\n    -   Flags values outside **\\[mean − 3×SD, mean + 3×SD\\]** as potential outliers.\n2.  **Hampel filter (median ± 3 MAD)**\n    -   Computes the **median** and **median absolute deviation (MAD)**.\\\n    -   Flags values outside **\\[median − 3×MAD, median + 3×MAD\\]** as robust outliers.\n\nOutliers are:\n\n-   **Flagged** in a long-format dataset (facility × month × indicator).\\\n-   Optionally **imputed** using local averages from neighboring months for the same facility when justified, while retaining flags for transparency.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code:outliers-detection\"}\ndata = t\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3. Internal consistency checks\n\nProgrammatic rules derived from malaria surveillance practice are encoded in R; for example:\n\n-   Tested cases ≥ confirmed cases\\\n-   Suspected cases ≥ tested cases\\\n-   Confirmed cases ≥ treated cases\\\n-   Malaria deaths ≤ total deaths\\\n-   Malaria admissions ≤ total admissions\n\nFor each facility-month, the script:\n\n-   Creates logical flags (“Normal” / “Not normal”) for each rule.\\\n-   Aggregates results by district and month to compute the **proportion of facility-months with incoherent data**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code: Internal Check\"}\ndata = t\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4. Facility activity and reporting completeness\n\nTo distinguish **inactive facilities** from **true zero values**:\n\n1.  For each facility-month, counts the number of **non-missing malaria indicators**.\\\n2.  Defines **activity status**:\n    -   `active` if at least one key malaria indicator is reported,\\\n    -   `inactive` otherwise.\n3.  Builds a **time series per facility** using a unique facility identifier and calendar date.\n4.  Computes for each district and month:\n    -   total number of facilities,\n    -   number of active facilities,\n    -   **reporting completeness (%)** = active facilities / total facilities × 100.\n\nThis produces district-level completeness trajectories over several years.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code: Facility and Reporting\"}\ndata = t\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Visualizations\n\nKey outputs include:\n\n-   **Heatmaps of missingness**\n    -   Percentage of missing values per indicator × month, faceted by district.\n-   **Scatter plots for coherence checks**\n    -   Tested vs confirmed cases, colored by coherence status, with regression lines.\n-   **Time series of reporting completeness**\n    -   Monthly completeness by district and at national level.\n\nDetailed interactive visualizations of this project are implemented in a dedicated Visualizations Chapter using Shiny (for dynamic R-based dashboards). These tools enable drill-downs by district, time-series filtering, and exportable insights for stakeholders.
