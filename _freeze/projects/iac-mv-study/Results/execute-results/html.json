While propensity score matching suggested\na modest protective association of arterial line placement among comparable patients,\nthis effect was attenuated in IPTW analyses estimating the population-average effect.\n\nThese findings suggest potential heterogeneity of treatment effect and limited\nevidence for a strong population-wide causal benefit.\n\n\n\n \n",
