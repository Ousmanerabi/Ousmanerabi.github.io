# Analysis Data Subject Level (ADSL) Generation with SAS

*Automated creation of ADSL dataset for clinical trials analysis using ADaM standards and multi-domain SDTM integration.*

## Introduction

The **Analysis Data Subject Level (ADSL)** dataset is the cornerstone of clinical trial statistical analysis under the CDISC Analysis Data Model (ADaM) standard. ADSL provides one record per subject containing all subject-level information needed for efficacy and safety analyses.

### What is ADaM ADSL?

ADSL serves as the foundation dataset that:

-   Contains one record per subject with subject-level analysis variables

-   Defines analysis populations (Safety, ITT, Per-Protocol)

-   Provides treatment information and study periods

-   Links to all other ADaM datasets through USUBJID

-   Ensures consistency across all statistical analyses

### Regulatory Importance

-   **FDA Requirement**: Essential for regulatory submissions

-   **Analysis Foundation**: Referenced by all BDS and OCCDS datasets

-   **Population Definition**: Critical for primary endpoint analyses

-   **Traceability**: Links analysis results back to SDTM source
