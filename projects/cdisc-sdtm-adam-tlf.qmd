## Overview

This simulated clinical study demonstrates the full CDISC-compliant programming workflow.\
The goal is to showcase hands-on experience with **SDTM and ADaM dataset creation**, **TLF generation**, **define.xml**, and **validation procedures**, following industry standards.

## Objectives

-   Create **SDTM domains** (e.g., DM, AE, EX, LB)

-   Derive **ADaM analysis datasets** (ADSL, ADAE, ADLB, ADTTE, etc.)

-   Generate **Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs)** for efficacy and safety

-   Implement **define.xml** for submission

-   Conduct **QC/validation** of deliverables.

## Methods

:::{.callout-note}

Tools & Environment

-   SAS OnDemand for Academics

-   Macros for derivations and QC

-   GitHub for version control & portfolio publication

:::

**Workflow Steps**

1.  Raw to SDTM

    -   Conversion of raw data into standardized SDTM datasets

    -   Controlled terminology applied

    -   Example: `dm.sas` to generate DM + SUPPDM.

2.  SDTN to ADaM

    -   Creation of subject-level analysis dataset (ADSL).

    -   Derivation of efficacy and safety datasets (e.g., ADAE, ADLB, ADTTE).

3.  ADaM to TLFs

    -   Programming of summary tables (e.g., demographics, adverse events).

    -   Listings for safety events

    -   Kaplanâ€“Meier survival plot for time-to-event endpoint.

4.  Documentation & define.xml

    -   Metadata mapping.

    -   Automated generation of define.xml.

5.  Validation

    -   Double programming for selected domains.

    -   QC macros for consistency across SDTM, ADaM, and TLFs.

## Deliverables

-   SDTM Datasets: DM, AE, EX, LB, SUPPDM

-   ADaM Datasets: ADSL, ADAE, ADLB, ADTTE

-   TLFs:

    -   Demographics table

    -   Adverse event summary table

    -   Safety listings

    -   Kaplan-Meier survival curve

-   define.xml

-   Validation Report

## Impact

This project highlights the **end-to-end workflow required in regulatory submissions**, proving competence in:

-   SDTM and ADaM standards

-   Statistical programming for clinical trials

-   Reproducible workflows

-   Industry documentation (define.xml, validation reports).
