This document presents a **methodological reimplementation** of a published study on the burden of antibacterial resistance on mortality in Marseille (AP-HM, 2014–2018).

-   No original **patient-level** or **confidential hospital data** are used here.

-   All analyses are based on **simulated** or **anonymized / reconstructed datasets** that replicate the patterns and methodology described in the original publication.

-   The aim is to demonstrate **Real-World Evidence (RWE) methods**, data engineering, and statistical modeling for my professional portfolio.

## Overview

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major challenge in clinical practice, and real-world data provide valuable insights into its true clinical burden beyond controlled trials.

This project reimplements, using simulated data, the analytical framework of a real-world evidence (RWE) study that assessed the impact of antibacterial resistance on hospital mortality across four university hospitals in Marseille, France

-   **Study type**: Retrospective, multi-center, observational real-world evidence study

-   **Data source (conceptual)**: Routine blood culture results (MARSS surveillance system) linked with hospital mortality

-   **Population**: All patients with at least one blood culture performed in AP-HM during the study period

-   **Primary outcome**: In-hospital mortality

-   **Key exposures**

    -   Resistance to key antibiotics for top bacterial species
    -   Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) phenotype
    -   Hospital-acquired infection, **ICU** admission, and other clinical factors

## Research Question

What is the real-world burden of antibacterial resistance on in-hospital mortality among patients with blood cultures in a large French university hospital system?

## Methods

### Study Design

Retrospective observational study based on routine laboratory and hospital data.\
Patients with at least one blood culture were followed until hospital discharge or death.

### Setting

-   Four University Hospitals of Marseille (AP-HM), France\
-   Study period: February 2014 – February 2018.

### Population & Variables

All patients with ≥1 blood culture (positive or negative).

Analyses focused on **positive cultures** involving the **10 most frequent bacterial species** in the deceased group, plus *Acinetobacter baumannii*.

**Variables**:

-   **Outcome:** In-hospital death (yes/no)
-   **Key exposures:**
    -   Resistance to key antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, amikacin)
    
    -   **DTR phenotype**: resistant to all first-line agents (Kadri et al. definition)
    
-   **Covariates:** Age (\>60 vs ≤60), sex, hospital-acquired infection (\>48h after admission), **ICU** admission, length of stay (\>14 days), bacterial species.

### Statistical Approach

Descriptive analyses summarized bacterial species distributions and resistance rates. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for in-hospital mortality associated with key exposures, including hospital-acquired infections, **ICU** admission, bacterial species, and DTR phenotype.

All results are based on **synthetic / simulated data** emulating published patterns.

### Abbreviations

**AMR**: antimicrobial resistance;  
**RWD**: real-world data;  
**RWE**: real-world evidence;  
**DTR**: difficult-to-treat resistance;  
**ICU**: intensive care unit;  
**AST**: antibiotic susceptibility testing.

## Results

-   Among all patients with blood cultures, those with **positive results** had nearly twice the mortality of those with negative cultures.

-   The most common bacteria in both groups were *Escherichia coli*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

-   Resistance to **ceftriaxone**, **ciprofloxacin**, and **imipenem** was more prevalent among deceased patients (@tbl-res-ecoli @tbl-res-fluo @tbl-res-C3G).

-   Polymicrobial bloodstream infections were more frequent among deceased patients (9.4%) than survivors (6.8%; p = 0.004). Excluding coagulase-negative staphylococci, *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae* predominated among the deceased, while *E. coli* and *S. aureus* were most frequent among survivors. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for a larger share of co-infections in the death group (72.2%) than in controls (48.6%) (@fig-chord).

-   **Hospital-acquired infection** (OR≈1.5), **ICU** admission (OR≈2.9), and *P. aeruginosa* or *E. faecium* infection (OR≈1.6–1.9) were independent mortality risk factors (@tbl-mlogit).

-   The **DTR phenotype** was rare (≈0.3%) but significantly more frequent among deceased patients (@fig-dtr).

## Key Messages (RWE)

- Positive blood cultures nearly doubled in-hospital mortality.

- ICU admission, hospital-acquired infection, and infections by *P. aeruginosa* / *E. faecium* remained independently associated with death.

- DTR phenotypes were rare but enriched among deceased patients.

:::


## Discussion

This analysis highlights the value of real-world data in quantifying the clinical burden of antimicrobial resistance and identifying high-risk patient groups. Integrating such insights into antimicrobial stewardship and hospital surveillance systems can guide targeted interventions and resource allocation.

### RWE Value

-   Demonstrates secondary use of hospital RWD for public health.

-   Replicates real-world associations outside clinical trial settings.

-   Highlights integration potential with HEOR studies (e.g., cost of AMR-related deaths).


### Perspective

Future applications of this analytical framework could include cost-effectiveness modeling, regional comparisons, and integration with national AMR surveillance systems.

### Limitations

-   Retrospective observational design.

-   Possible misclassification of infection source.

-   Analyses conducted on **synthetic / anonymized data**, not actual hospital data.
