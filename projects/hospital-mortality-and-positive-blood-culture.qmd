## Disclaimer – Educational Reimplementation Only

This document presents a **methodological reimplementation** of a published study on the burden of antibacterial resistance on mortality in Marseille (AP-HM, 2014–2018).

-   No original **patient-level** or **confidential hospital data** are used here.

-   All analyses are based on **simulated** or **anonymized / reconstructed datasets** that replicate the patterns and methodology described in the original publication.

-   The aim is to demonstrate **Real-World Evidence (RWE) methods**, data engineering, and statistical modeling for my professional portfolio.

The results presented here **must not** be interpreted as official AP-HM results.

# Overview
This project reproduces, using simulated or reconstructed data, the analytical pipeline of a real-world evidence (RWE) study that quantified the impact of antibacterial resistance on in-hospital mortality among patients with blood cultures in the four University Hospitals of Marseille (AP-HM) between February 2014 and February 2018

## Real-world Evidence (RWE) Framing

- **Study type**: Retrospective, multi-center, observational real-world evidence study

- **Data source (conceptual)**: Routine blood culture results (MARSS surveillance system) linked with hospital mortality

- **Population**: All patients with at least one blood culture performed in AP-HM during the study period

- **Primary outcome**: In-hospital mortality

- **Key exposures**
  - Resistance to key antibiotics for top bacterial species
  - Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) phenotype
  - Hospital-acquired infection, ICU admission, and other clinical factors

## Research Question

What is the real-world burden of antibacterial resistance on in-hospital mortality among patients with blood cultures in a large French university hospital system?
