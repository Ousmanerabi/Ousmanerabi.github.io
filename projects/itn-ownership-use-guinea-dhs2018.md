## Overview
Analysis of the 2018 Guinea Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to identify determinants of **ownership** and **use** of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) at both household and individual levels. The goal was to inform the National Malaria Control Program’s distribution and communication strategies.

## Key Highlights
- Main variables: wealth quintiles, education level, urban/rural setting, household composition.
- Two main outcomes: **ITN ownership** and **ITN use the previous night** (among those with access).
- Accounted for complex survey design: weights, strata, and clusters.

## Methods & Tools
Survey-weighted logistic regression models were implemented using R (`survey`, `srvyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tmap`) to estimate adjusted odds ratios and visualize disparities.

## Deliverables
- Tables and figures for manuscript and policy brief.
- Fully reproducible R scripts (data cleaning, indicator generation, modeling).

## Impact
- Provided evidence to better target **priority groups** in ITN distribution campaigns.
- Informed recommendations for tailoring behavior change communication messages.
