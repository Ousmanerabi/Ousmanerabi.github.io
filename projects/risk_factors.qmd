**Project Role**: Research Assistant Professor & Lead Author

**Timeline**: 2021-2022

**Status**: Published in peer-reviewed journal

## Overview

Analysis of the 2018 Guinea Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to identify determinants of **ownership** and **use** of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) at both household and individual levels. Understanding the factors influencing household ITN ownership and usage among those with access will enable the Guinea National Malaria Control Programme to design targeted interventions aimed at increasing bed net coverage and utilization.

## Research Leadership & Study Design

**Independent Research Initiative**:

Conceived, designed, and executed comprehensive epidemiological analysis of ITN utilization patterns in Guinea using complex survey methodology. Led complete research lifecycle from study conceptualization through manuscript publication and policy dissemination.

**Research Innovation**:

Developed analytical framework addressing both household-level ownership and individual-level usage patterns, incorporating complex survey design features often overlooked in DHS analyses. Published methodology serves as template for similar national-level studies.

## Methodology

### Study Design

-   **Data Source**: Guinea DHS 2018 (nationally representative)
-   **Study Population**: Households and individuals across Guinea's administrative regions
-   **Analytical Approach**: Multi-level logistic regression with survey weights

### Key Variables Analyzed

**Outcomes**:

-   ITN ownership at household level

-   ITN usage the previous night (among those with access) at individual-level

**Predictors**:

-   **Socioeconomic**: Wealth quintiles, education level, household size

-   **Demographic**: Age and sex of household head, marital status, pregnancy status

-   **Geographic**: Urban/rural residence, administrative region

-   **Structural**: Number of rooms, presence of children under 5

### Statistical Methods

**Complex Survey Design Adjustment**:

-   Survey weights applied for population representativeness

-   Stratification and clustering accounted for in variance estimation

-   Design effects calculated for precision assessment

**Analytical Framework**:

#| label: Bivariate and Univariate analysis of different risk factors for ITN ownership at the country level
#| fig-cap: "Regional distribution"
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

## Install and charge the survey design library

library(survey)

# Survey design specification

design_sample <- svydesign(
  ids = ~hv021, 
  strata = ~hv022, 
  weights = ~wt,
  num_p=1,
  nest = T,
  data = hh_ex
)

## Bivariate analysis

explanatory_vars <- c("wealth", "sex", "urb", "Num_childre", "region", "rooms", "hh_size", "Edu", "head_age", "Marital")

for(i in 1:length(explanatory_vars)){
  col = explanatory_vars[i]
  tbl <- survey::svytable(~HH_at_least_one + col, design_sample_hh)
  t = summary(tbl, statistic="Chisq")
  t = plyr::ldply(t)
}


## Univariate analysis of different risk factors for ITN ownership at the country level 

models <- explanatory_vars %>%      
  stringr::str_c("HH_at_least_one ~ ", .) %>%      
  
  # iterate through each univariate formula
  purrr::map(                               
    .f = ~survey::svyglm(                      
      formula = as.formula(.x),      
      family = "binomial",           
      design = design_sample_hh)) %>%       
  

  purrr::map(
    .f = ~broom::tidy(
      .x, 
      exponentiate = TRUE,           
      conf.int = TRUE)) %>%         
  
 
  dplyr::bind_rows() %>% 
  
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))

## Key Findings

### Visual Highlights

![Two-dimensional histogram showing the number of people who could use nets owned by the household if all nets were in use, stratified by household size, in the 2018 Guinea DHS.](images/two_dimensionel.png)

### ITN Ownership Patterns

**Geographic Disparities**:

-   Significant regional variation in ownership rates

-   Urban-rural differentials identified

-   Hotspot mapping revealed priority intervention areas

**Socioeconomic Determinants**:

-   Wealth quintile emerged as strongest predictor

-   Education level positively associated with ownership

-   Household composition effects documented

### Usage Among Those with Access

**Behavioral Factors**:

-   Gap identified between access and utilization

-   Individual-level characteristics influence usage patterns

-   Opportunity for targeted behavior change interventions

## Technical Implementation

### Tools & Packages Used

-   R Programming: `survey`, `srvyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`

-   Geospatial Analysis: `tmap`, `sf` for mapping

-   Reproducible Reporting: Quarto/R Markdown workflow

### Data Management

-   Complex survey data cleaning and validation
-   Multiple imputation for missing data
-   Quality control procedures implemented

### Visualization Approach

```{r}
#| label: Maps
#| fig-cap: "Regional distribution"
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

# Example: Regional variation mapping
library(tmap)
guinea_map <- tm_shape(guinea_regions) +
  tm_polygons("ITN_ownership", 
              style = "quantile",
              palette = "Blues",
              title = "ITN Ownership %") +
  tm_layout(title = "Regional ITN Ownership Patterns")
```
