### Overview

Analysis of the 2018 Guinea Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to identify determinants of **ownership** and **use** of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) at both household and individual levels. Understanding the factors influencing household ITN ownership and usage among those with access will enable the Guinea National Malaria Control Programme to design targeted interventions aimed at increasing bed net coverage and utilization.

### **Key Highlights**

-   Main variables: wealth quintiles, education level, urban/rural setting, age of household head, age of individual, sex of household head, sex of individual, household size, number of rooms, marital status, children under five, pregnant status, and region.

-   Two main outcomes: **ITN ownership** and **ITN use the previous night** (among those with access).

-   Accounted for complex survey design: weights, strata, and clusters.

### **Methods & Tools**

Survey-weighted logistic regression models were implemented in R (`survey`, `srvyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tmap`) to estimate adjusted odds ratios and visualize disparities.

### **Impact**

-   Evidence to better target **priority groups** in ITN distribution campaigns.

-   Recommendations to tailor behavior change communication messages.

### Code example

```{r}
#| label: Bivariate and Univariate analysis of different risk factors for ITN ownership at the country level
#| fig-cap: "Regional distribution"
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

## Install and charge the survey design library

library(survey)

## Bivariate analysis

explanatory_vars <- c("wealth", "sex", "urb", "Num_childre", "region", "rooms", "hh_size", "Edu", "head_age", "Marital")

for(i in 1:length(explanatory_vars)){
  col = explanatory_vars[i]
  tbl <- survey::svytable(~HH_at_least_one + col, design_sample_hh)
  t = summary(tbl, statistic="Chisq")
  t = plyr::ldply(t)
}


## Univariate analysis of different risk factors for ITN ownership at the country level 

models <- explanatory_vars %>%      
  stringr::str_c("HH_at_least_one ~ ", .) %>%      
  
  # iterate through each univariate formula
  purrr::map(                               
    .f = ~survey::svyglm(                      
      formula = as.formula(.x),      
      family = "binomial",           
      design = design_sample_hh)) %>%       
  

  purrr::map(
    .f = ~broom::tidy(
      .x, 
      exponentiate = TRUE,           
      conf.int = TRUE)) %>%         
  
 
  dplyr::bind_rows() %>% 
  
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, digits = 2))
