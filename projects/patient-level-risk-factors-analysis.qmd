## Real-World Evidence Summary

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
-   **Study Type:** Retrospective longitudinal observational study

-   **RWD source:** IeDA electronic consultation data from primary health centers (CSPS)

-   **Population:** Children 2–60 months in IeDA districts (Burkina Faso, 2017, 2018, 2020)

-   **Outcome:** Clinical malaria episode at consultation (yes/no)

-   **Method:** Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE, logit link, exchangeable correlation)

-   **Objective:** Quantify the real-world association between demographic, nutritional, immunization, and infection-related factors and malaria risk under routine care conditions

-   **Key insight:** Age, HIV status, distance to facility, prior malaria episodes and seasonality strongly shape malaria risk; vaccination and malnutrition show age-dependent effects.

## Overview

Real-world data (RWD) from electronic decision-support systems can capture disease burden and risk factors under everyday programmatic conditions that randomized trials cannot represent.\
This study leveraged the **IeDA** platform — a digital clinical tool used in Burkina Faso’s primary-care system — to generate **real-world evidence (RWE)** on malaria risk factors among children under five.

The analysis reframes academic results into an **RWE-compliant framework** aligned with ISPOR/EMA real-world study design principles.

## Real-World Data & Study Design

| Aspect | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Data Source** | IeDA electronic consultations (CSPS facilities) |
| **Geographic Scope** | Multiple districts implementing IeDA |
| **Study Period** | 2017, 2018, 2020 (2019 excluded) |
| **Study Population** | Children aged 2–60 months with ≥ 1 consultation |
| **Design** | Retrospective longitudinal cohort (repeated visits per child) |
| **Unit of Analysis** | Consultation record |
| **Perspective** | Population-averaged effects at patient-encounter level |

## Endpoint

::: callout-tip
-   **Primary outcome:** presence of a confirmed malaria episode at each consultation\
-   **Covariates:** age (+ age²), sex, malnutrition status, HIV status, vaccination completeness (BCG, pentavalent, pneumococcal, polio, rotavirus), prior malaria episode, month of visit (seasonality), distance to facility, district.

## Analytical Framework

The analysis used **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)** to model repeated malaria outcomes per child.

### RWE Methodology Highlights

-   RWD Quality Controls: duplicate removal, harmonized identifiers, imputation of missing facility data, age-window validation.

-   Confounding Mitigation: multivariable adjustment; sensitivity cohorts (4–60 mo and 6–60 mo)

-   Effect Modification: age interactions tested for sex, nutrition, HIV, and vaccines.

-   Outcome Reporting: adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95 % CIs; p \< 0.05 as significance threshold.

## Insights

| Domain | Real-World Finding | Interpretation |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Age** | Malaria risk rises non-linearly with age (2 → 60 mo). | Likely reflects increased exposure and partial immunity. |
| **Sex** | Girls show slightly higher odds of malaria than boys. | Possible behavioural and biological differences. |
| **Nutrition** | Moderate/global malnutrition linked with lower observed odds. | May reflect health-seeking or survivor bias in RWD. |
| **HIV Status** | HIV-positive children have 1.7–2.0× higher adjusted odds. | Aligns with prior longitudinal evidence. |
| **Distance to Facility** | Risk increases with travel distance (\> 10 km \> 4–10 km \> \< 4 km). | Indicates access barriers in real-world settings. |
| **Seasonality** | From July–October, malaria probability ≈ 3× higher than in May. | Confirms expected transmission peaks. |
| **Vaccination** | BCG and other vaccines show protective trends but non-significant in adjusted model. | Reflects indirect benefits and data heterogeneity. |

### Forest plots (single multivariable GEE model)

All three forest plots below are derived from the **same multivariable GEE model** (population-averaged effects with an exchangeable correlation structure).\
For visualization purposes, covariates are grouped into three panels:

1.  **Demographic and clinical factors** (age, sex, prior malaria, HIV, malnutrition)\
2.  **Access and seasonality factors** (distance to facility, month of visit, district)\
3.  **Vaccination status** (BCG, pentavalent, pneumococcal, rotavirus, polio)

### Age-modified effects (interaction plots)

To reflect **effect modification by age**, we extended the main GEE model with interaction terms between age and selected risk factors (e.g. sex, malnutrition, HIV status, distance, and vaccination).\
The plots below show **predicted probabilities of a malaria episode across age** for key subgroups, based on the fitted interaction model:

-   Age × sex\
-   Age × malnutrition status\
-   Age × distance to nearest health facility\
-   Age × HIV status\
-   Age × BCG / pentavalent / pneumococcal / polio / rotavirus vaccination

## RWE Interpretation and Impact

**Clinical relevance**: The study demonstrates how longitudinal RWD can uncover real-world risk gradients across demographic and programmatic factors in pediatric malaria.

**Programmatic insight**: Results support integrated malaria–nutrition–immunization strategies and highlight access inequities (distance to facility, HIV coinfection).

**Methodological contribution**: Establishes a reproducible RWE pipeline using routine digital health data, showing that IeDA can serve as a valid RWD source for health-system performance and disease-risk monitoring.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

-   **Real-World Data Management**: large-scale data cleaning, QC, and cohort curation.

-   **Statistical Programming**: longitudinal modelling with geepack, broom, gtsummary.

-   **Epidemiological Methods**: GEE for correlated binary outcomes; effect-modification assessment.

-   **RWE Reporting**: alignment with ISPOR/EMA/ICH E3 guidelines; real-world endpoint definition.

-   **Reproducibility**: fully scripted Quarto workflow and transparent code base. :::
