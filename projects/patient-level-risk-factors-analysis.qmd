# Patient-level risk factors for clinical malaria among children aged 2–60 months


## Overview

This study assessed the patient-level factors associated with clinical malaria among children under five using real-world Integrated Electronic Diagnosis Approach (IeDA) consultation data from Burkina Faso (2017–2020). Using a longitudinal framework and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling, we assessed how nutritional status, vaccination completeness, HIV status, and prior malaria episodes influence the odds of clinical malaria.
