**Note:** All plots labeled *“Original published figure”* are taken from **Diallo et al., Scientific Reports (2020)**.

All analytical steps in this portfolio project (data structure design, data cleaning, harmonization of AST results, resistance calculations, DTR classification, and statistical workflow) are reproduced using **fully simulated datasets** to ensure GDPR and data protection compliance.

No original isolate-level or patient-level data were reused.

# Overview

This portfolio project reconstructs the analytical workflow and Real-World Evidence (RWE) methodology from the peer-reviewed publication:

> **Diallo OO et al. Major discrepancy between factual antibiotic resistance and consumption in South of France. *Scientific Reports* 2020;10:18262.**

The goal is not to reproduce the original results, but to demonstrate the full RWE analytic pipeline using **synthetic data modeled after the real-world microbiology surveillance network** used in the publication.

This approach allows:

-   faithful reconstruction of the study design,
-   demonstration of large-scale RWE data engineering skills,
-   reproduction of the DTR classification approach,
-   and illustration of AMR trend analysis techniques—

while remaining fully compliant with GDPR and ethical requirements.

Original figures from the publication are included for scientific context and comparison.

# Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often quantified using **predictive mathematical models**, which may not reflect real-world patterns.

The Scientific Reports study analyzed **539,037 bacterial isolates** collected across **267 laboratories** to quantify:

-   Real-world resistance trends over time

-   Discrepancies between resistance and antibiotic consumption

-   Prevalence of **Difficult-to-Treat (DTR)** phenotypes (Kadri et al.)

-   Temporal evolution of key pathogens (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, A. baumannii…)

This portfolio project reproduces the **analytic strategy**, **statistical logic**, and **visual narratives** using simulated data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objectives of This RWE Reproduction

1.  Reconstruct the study design used in the original 2020 publication.

2.  Create a clean analytic workflow using modern RWE standards.

3.  Simulate datasets matching the structure and distribution of the original study.

4.  Reproduce key indicators:

    -   Resistance to key antibiotics

    -   Temporal trends (2014–2018)

    -   DTR classification

5.  Produce RWE-style visualizations (forest plots, timeline trends).

6.  Summarize clinical and public health implications.

This exercise demonstrates **RWE reproducibility, analytical rigor, and epidemiological reasoning**, essential in the pharmaceutical industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Real-World Data Structure (Simulated Version)

The original study used routine-care laboratory data from:

-   **BALYSES** (real-time bacterial monitoring system)

-   **MARSS** (Marseille AMR surveillance)

-   **PACA SurvE** (regional epidemiology system)

To maintain ethical compliance, this portfolio project uses:

-   **simulated datasets**

-   distributions calibrated on published tables

-   aggregate-level counts consistent with Scientific Reports 2020

The following data elements are reproduced:

-   Sample type (urine, blood culture, deep, respiratory)

-   Bacterial species (15 most frequent clinical pathogens)

-   Antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) outcomes

-   Key antibiotics for each species

-   Year of isolation

-   DTR phenotype classification

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Methods (Reconstructed)

### Study Design

-   Retrospective, observational, non-interventional RWD study (2014–2018).

-   No linked clinical data (mortality, comorbidity).

-   Unit of analysis: **isolate**, not patient.

### Inclusion Criteria

-   Isolates from the 15 most frequent pathogens.

-   At least one **key antibiotic** tested per species.

### Resistance Definition

-   EUCAST breakpoints

-   Intermediate considered resistant (per original study)

### DTR Classification

Reproduced using the Kadri et al. algorithm:

-   **GNB**: resistant to all β-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones

-   **Gram-positive**: resistant to (methicillin + gentamicin + vancomycin) or equivalent triads

### Statistical Modeling

-   Mann–Whitney U

-   χ² and Fisher exact tests

-   Kendall correlation for trends

-   p \< 0.05 considered significant

This statistical logic is faithfully reconstructed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key RWE Insights (From Simulated Reproduction)

Although data are simulated, trends reproduce the structure of published findings:

## 1. Resistance trends remained globally stable (2014–2018)

-   Global stability across most pathogen–antibiotic pairs

-   No major shifts in *S. aureus*, *Enterobacterales*, or *P. aeruginosa*

-   Clear exceptions highlighted below

![Figure 1: Trend in resistance to key antibiotics for E. coli (simulated RWE)](images/amr_trends_panels.png)

## 2. Significant reductions in resistance

-   **Amikacin resistance** decreased in *E. coli*, *K. pneumoniae*, *P. mirabilis*, *K. oxytoca*.

-   **Imipenem resistance** declined in *A. baumannii*.

## 3. Significant increases in resistance

-   Ceftriaxone resistance in:
    -   *E. cloacae*

    -   *K. aerogenes*

    -   *K. oxytoca*

## Species distribution (simulated RWD)

![Figure 2: Most frequently isolated bacterial soecies](images/most_frequent.png)

## 4. Resistance profiles across pathogens

This heatmap summarizes the resistance phenotypes by pathogen and antibiotic class, highlighting strong resistance clusters (e.g., *E. faecium*, *A. baumannii*) and preserved susceptibilities in Gram-positive organisms.

![Fig 3: Heatmap resistance profiles](images/heatmap_atb_spec.png)

## 5. Prevalence of DTR Phenotypes

-   **0.3% of isolates**

-   Mostly Gram-negative

-   Lower than rates reported in U.S. hospital networks

-   No upward trend observed

# Clinical & Public Health Interpretation

This project supports the central conclusion of the 2020 Scientific Reports article:

-   **High antibiotic consumption does not automatically translate into higher resistance.**

-   Predictive AMR models may overestimate the burden in certain contexts.

-   Real-time laboratory surveillance (RWD) provides a **more accurate and actionable picture**.

-   Routine-care AMR data can guide empirical treatment and stewardship programs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Ethical Considerations

To ensure strict compliance:

-   **No original data** from the published study are reused.

-   Only **synthetic, simulated, or aggregated** datasets are used.

-   No identifiable patient information is present.

-   The project is solely for **educational and portfolio purposes**.

-   The analytic framework is recreated, not the dataset.

This aligns with GDPR, HIPAA, and good RWE practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Limitations

-   Simulated data cannot perfectly replicate the distribution of real isolates.

-   No patient-level linkage (mortality, comorbidities).

-   Results cannot be used for clinical decision-making.

-   Geographic specificity limits generalizability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
