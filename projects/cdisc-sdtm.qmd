Note: In the corresponding GitHub repository <https://github.com/Ousmanerabi/clinical-trials-programming-portfolio/tree/main>, I used SAS macros to create, format, and validate the SDTM domains.\
These macros were adapted from reference books I studied while preparing for the SAS Clinical Trials Programming Certification.

:::

### Objective 

This project demonstrates the preparation of raw clinical trial data into CDISC SDTM-ready format. The example focuses on the Demographics (DM) domain, which captures subject-level information required for regulatory submission. The DM domain follows the standard SDTM structure, with one record per subject.

### Methodology

The process was simplified for demonstration purposes but reflects the key steps followed in industry practice:

1.  Identify required variables based on **SDTM Implementation Guide (SDTMIG v3.4)**
    -   Identifier variables : `STUDYID`, `DOMAIN`, `USUBJID`

    -   Topic variables: `USUBJID`

    -   Timing variables : `RFSTDTC`, `RFENDTC`, **`RFXSTDTC`**, `RFXENDTC`

    -   Qualifier variables : `SITEID`, `SEX`, `AGE`, `RACE`, `COUNTRY`
2.  Create an empty dataset structure using SAS macro
3.  Apply metadata-driven macros to format variables and enforce controlled terminology
4.  Validate dataset structure to ensure compliance with CDISC standards

### Tools

-   **SAS OnDemand for Academics :** used to build and test the dataset

-   **Macro:** adapted from textbooks used in SAS Clinical Trials Programming certification preparation (*Implementing CDISC Using SAS*, *Validating Clinical Trial Data Reporting with SAS*)

-   **CDISC SDTMIG v3.2:** for required/expected variable definitions

### Outputs

Below is the expected structure of the DM domain:
