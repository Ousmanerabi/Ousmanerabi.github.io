### Patient Population

A total of 61,532 patients were admitted to the ICU. After applying the predefined exclusion criteria, the final analytical cohort included 1,740 mechanically ventilated patients, of whom 612 (35.2%) were exposed to invasive arterial catheterization (IAC) and 1,128 (64.8%) were not exposed (see Figure 1). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1.



### Covariate balance

Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) substantially improved covariate balance across all measured variables.

After adjustment, all standardized mean differences were below 0.10, indicating adequate balance between exposure groups.

### Association between arterial line placement and 28-day mortality

#### Propensity score–matched analysis

In the propensity score–matched cohort, arterial line placement was associated with a lower odds of 28-day mortality (OR XX, 95% CI XX–XX, p = XX).

```

#### Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)

In IPTW analyses estimating the average treatment effect in the overall population, arterial line placement was not significantly associated with 28-day mortality (OR XX, 95% CI XX–XX, p = XX).

### Comparison of causal estimands

Results differed by analytical approach. While propensity score matching suggested a modest protective association of arterial line placement among comparable patients, this effect was attenuated in IPTW analyses estimating the population-average effect.

These findings suggest potential heterogeneity of treatment effect and limited evidence for a strong population-wide causal benefit.
