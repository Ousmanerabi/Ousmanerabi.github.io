## Results

 
Overall 61,532 patients were admitted in ICU. After applying exclusion criteria, the analysis included a total of 1740 patients.  
<!-- We analyzed 2899 ICU admissions meeting the inclusion criteria.  -->
<!-- Among these, XX patients (XX%) received invasive arterial catheterization (IAC) within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation initiation. -->


### Baseline characteristics

Before adjustment, patients receiving IAC differed from those without IAC in several baseline characteristics, including age, ICU type, insurance status, admission type, and comorbidity burden.

### Covariate balance

Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)
substantially improved covariate balance across all measured variables.

After adjustment, all standardized mean differences were below 0.10, indicating
adequate balance between exposure groups.

### Association between arterial line placement and 28-day mortality
#### Propensity score–matched analysis

In the propensity score–matched cohort, arterial line placement was associated
with a lower odds of 28-day mortality (OR XX, 95% CI XX–XX, p = XX).

```


#### Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)

In IPTW analyses estimating the average treatment effect in the overall population,
arterial line placement was not significantly associated with 28-day mortality
(OR XX, 95% CI XX–XX, p = XX).

### Comparison of causal estimands

Results differed by analytical approach. While propensity score matching suggested
a modest protective association of arterial line placement among comparable patients,
this effect was attenuated in IPTW analyses estimating the population-average effect.

These findings suggest potential heterogeneity of treatment effect and limited
evidence for a strong population-wide causal benefit.
