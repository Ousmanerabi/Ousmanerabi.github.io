## 2. Abstract

### Background

Indwelling arterial catheters (IACs) are widely used in intensive care units (ICUs) for continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling, especially among mechanically ventilated (MV) patients. While IACs may improve monitoring, they are invasive and can be associated with complications (e.g., vascular injury, infection). Observational associations between IAC use and mortality are difficult to interpret because sicker patients are more likely to receive an IAC (**confounding by indication**) and because exposure timing can introduce **immortal time bias** if not handled carefully.

### Research question and objectives

Among **mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients** who are **not receiving vasopressors** in the first 24 hours after MV initiation, is **early IAC exposure (0–24h after MV start)**, compared with no early IAC exposure, associated with:

- primary outocome : **28-day all-cause mortality**

- Secondary outcomes : **ICU length of stay** and **monitoring intensity (e.g., ABG/day)** (feasibility-dependent)

### Methods

We will conduct a retrospective, observational analysis using the **MIMIC-III** ICU EHR database. We define **time zero** as the earliest timestamp indicating invasive mechanical ventilation during an ICU stay (**MV start**). We classify patients as exposed if an arterial line is documented/placed **within 0–24 hours after MV start**. Patients without documented arterial line placement during the exposure window are classified as unexposed.

To reduce confounding, we will estimate adjusted associations using 

- (1) multivariable logistic regression and 

- (2) propensity score methods (matching or weighting). 

Due to computational/storage constraints, high-frequency event tables (e.g., `chartevents`, `labevents`) may be unavailable; therefore, baseline covariate adjustment will rely on variables feasible to extract (e.g., demographics, admission characteristics, comorbidities/diagnoses, ICU/service type, and vasoactive medication exposure from input tables). Results will be reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, with transparent reporting of limitations due to unavailable physiologic/laboratory covariates.

## 5. Rationale and background

Mechanically ventilated ICU patients require close monitoring of ventilation, oxygenation, and hemodynamics. IACs can facilitate continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring and repeated ABG sampling, but their risks and benefits are debated. Observational ICU studies of IAC use are vulnerable to:

- **Confounding by indication**: clinicians preferentially place IACs in more severely ill patients.
- **Immortal time bias**: if exposure is defined as “ever got IAC” during a follow-up period beginning at MV start, exposed patients must survive long enough to receive an IAC. This can bias comparisons if not handled with an explicit exposure window aligned to time zero.

This protocol uses an explicit **time zero** (MV initiation) and a prespecified **early exposure window (0–24 hours)** to align patient eligibility, exposure classification, and follow-up, supporting clearer causal interpretation under real-world constraints.


## 6. Research question and objectives

### A. Primary research question and objective

| **Study element** | **Specification** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Objective** | Estimate the association between **early IAC exposure (0–24h after MV start)** and **28-day mortality** among mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients **not receiving vasopressors in the first 24h after MV start**. |
| **Hypothesis** | Early IAC exposure is **not** associated with lower 28-day mortality after adjustment (null hypothesis). |
| **Population** | Adult ICU patients in **MIMIC-III** who (1) received invasive MV, (2) meet eligibility/exclusion criteria, and (3) can be classified for exposure and outcome. |
| **Exposure** | **Early IAC**: arterial line documented/placed **within 0–24h** after MV start. |
| **Comparator** | No arterial line documentation/placement during the 0–24h exposure window (primary definition). |
| **Outcome** | 28-day all-cause mortality (in-hospital death within 28 days of MV start, as available in MIMIC-III). |
| **Time** | **Time zero:** MV start. **Follow-up:** up to 28 days after MV start, or until hospital discharge/death (whichever occurs first, depending on available timestamps). |
| **Setting** | Adult ICUs captured in **MIMIC-III** (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). |
| **Main measure of effect** | Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for 28-day mortality from multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score–based models. |

### B. Secondary research questions and objectives (feasibility-dependent)

| **Study element** | **Specification** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Objective** | Assess whether early IAC exposure is associated with (1) ICU LOS, and (2) monitoring intensity (e.g., ABG/day) when required tables are available. |
| **Population** | Same as primary analysis. |
| **Exposure/Comparator** | Same as primary analysis. |
| **Outcomes** | (1) ICU LOS in days; (2) ABG/day (requires ABG identification from event tables). |
| **Time** | For ICU LOS: entire ICU stay. For ABG/day: ICU stay (or MV period), depending on data availability. |
| **Main measure of effect** | LOS: adjusted mean difference or time-to-discharge model; ABG/day: Poisson/negative binomial rate ratio. |

## 7. Research methods

### Study design

Retrospective observational cohort study using routinely collected ICU EHR data from **MIMIC-III**.

This protocol is **target-trial–inspired**:

- **Eligibility** is assessed at/near time zero (MV start).
- **Exposure** is assigned within a prespecified window (0–24h after MV start).
- **Follow-up** begins at time zero for the outcome of interest.

This design helps reduce immortal time bias relative to an “ever exposed” definition.

### Key design definitions

#### Time zero
**MV initiation (MV start)** within an ICU stay.

#### Exposure window (0–24h)
A patient is classified as **early IAC exposed** if the earliest documented arterial line placement/event occurs in **[MV start, MV start + 24h)**.

Patients without arterial line evidence in this window are classified as unexposed (primary definition).

> **Important distinction**  
> *Time zero* defines when follow-up begins (MV start).  
> The *exposure window* defines when exposure status is determined (0–24h after time zero).  
> These are not the same concept.

### Settings and variables

**Setting**  
ICU encounters from MIMIC-III (BIDMC). Data are queried from a PostgreSQL database (AWS RDS).

**Primary exposure**  
- Early IAC placement/documentation within 0–24h of MV start (derived from procedure/event documentation).

**Primary outcome**  
- 28-day all-cause mortality (in-hospital death within 28 days after MV start, based on available death time fields).

**Key covariates (pragmatic, feasibility-driven)**

Because high-frequency event tables (e.g., `chartevents`, `labevents`) may be unavailable due to storage constraints, baseline adjustment will prioritize variables extractable from smaller/feasible tables:

- Demographics: age (at ICU admission), sex, ethnicity (from admissions/demographics tables as available)
- Admission characteristics: admission type, service category (medical vs surgical), ICU stay order
- Comorbidity proxies: ICD-9 diagnosis-based comorbidity measures (e.g., Charlson) where feasible
- Vasopressor exposure: vasopressor administration in first 24h after MV start (used as an exclusion and/or covariate)

**Explicitly not included in v2.0 (due to data constraints)**
- Day-1 labs and high-resolution vitals from `labevents`/`chartevents`, if these tables are unavailable in the working environment.

### Inclusion/exclusion criteria (operational)

1. Adult patients: age ≥ 16 years
2. Mechanically ventilated during ICU stay; MV start defined
3. MV start occurs early relative to ICU admission: within first 24h of ICU admission 
4. ICU LOS above minimum threshold 
5. First ICU stay per patient (to avoid correlated observations and simplify interpretation)
6. Exclude surgical service admissions
7. Exclude vasopressor use in the first 24h after MV start (primary population definition)
8. Patients admitted to the **Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU)** were excluded (n = 60). In this unit, indwelling arterial catheters are frequently placed prior to ICU admission and prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation, leading to structural exposure misclassification and lack of comparability with non-exposed patients.

### Statistical analysis plan

#### Descriptive analysis
- Summarize baseline characteristics by early IAC exposure status.
- Report standardized mean differences (SMD) for covariate balance.

#### Primary analysis (28-day mortality)
- Multivariable logistic regression:
  - Outcome: death_28d
  - Predictor: early IAC exposure
  - Adjust for feasible confounders (demographics, admission/service features, comorbidity proxies)

#### Propensity score analysis
- Fit a propensity score model for early IAC exposure using the same feasible covariates.
- Apply:
  - 1:1 nearest neighbor matching **or**
  - IPTW with stabilized weights
- Re-estimate association with weighted/matched outcome model.
- Assess balance using SMD before/after.

#### Sensitivity analyses (planned)
- Alternative exposure definitions:
  - “Any IAC during ICU stay” (risk of immortal time bias; reported as sensitivity only)
  - Alternative exposure windows (e.g., 0–12h, 0–48h)
- Alternative eligibility rules:
  - Different LOS thresholds
  - Include vs exclude surgical service (covariate vs exclusion)
- Outcome definition sensitivity:
  - Use additional death fields (e.g., patient-level date of death) when available/appropriate and consistent with MIMIC-III.

### Data management & reproducibility

- SQL-first cohort extraction; R used for analysis.
- Version control via GitHub; all derivations documented.
- Deliverables include cohort flowchart, SQL scripts, and analysis scripts.

### Quality control

- Unit checks and sanity checks for timestamps (MV start within ICU stay bounds).
- Internal checks for duplicates (icustay_id uniqueness).
- Validation of exposure/outcome construction on random samples.


## 8. Limitations

- **Residual confounding** remains possible, particularly if severity-of-illness measures and high-resolution vitals/labs are unavailable.
- **Exposure misclassification** is possible because IAC documentation may be incomplete or recorded after placement.
- **Single-center** ICU data may limit generalizability.
- **Operational definitions** (e.g., MV start derived from available tables) may differ from bedside reality; all logic is explicitly documented.


## 9. Protection of human subjects

This project uses de-identified MIMIC-III data under the PhysioNet data use agreement. No re-identification is attempted. The project qualifies as non-human subjects research as conducted on de-identified data (institutional determinations may vary).


## 10. Reporting of adverse events

Not applicable (retrospective analysis of de-identified data).
